Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This where I intend to share my thoughts and insights to anyone who may be
interested. Although this may be only a few people or none at all this is where I hope to see the progress in own personal journey as I try to become a more astute and well-rounded individual.

At this current stage I am four years into an undergraduate degree program studying Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh and so this may be a sign of the content tha thte blogs will contain. It is no surprise that much of the content here will have its roots in the realms of computing. But, don't be mistaken; my interests in the field are broad and ever-evolving. From devling into machine learning applications onto exploring the creative avenues of web design. I am continually expanding my horizons, endeavoring to make an informed choice about my future speciailizations.

Yet, my interests reach beyond technology, I have a fondness of finance, music and sports, particularily rugby and football. So, don't be surprised to find a diverse palette of topics.

As a student, I am also continually learning and growing, and it is my hope that this blog will serve as a reflection of my ongoing journey. From a breakdown of the latest research, breaking down complex algorithms to discussing my projects, I wish to bring anyone intersting, on this journey.

Welcome abroad!

Sean
